Here's the basic idea (without too much detail).

Ingredients:
- Two slices of "box" bread.
- One banana.
- Some beacon.
- Some peanut butter.

Pre-process:
- Fry the beacon.
- Toast the bread.
- Slice the banana.

Process:
- Put some peanut butter on the bread. Inside the sandwitch put the banana and the beacon.

Post-process:
- Enjoy and jot down ideas for the next time you do this same sandwich. For instance, maybe you want more beacon or want to adjust how light or dark the toasted bread should be.
